## Indirectly deduced names for Utah

### Flaming Gorge

The visitor center bears the name "Flaming Gorge", which also appears
on distance signs. The position used is that of the center of the dam.

### Fort Duchesne

A small sign marking the Ute tribal justice center in "Ft. Duchesne",
plus a single distance sign in Duchesne.

### Herriman

A prominent building bears the text "Herriman City Hall".

### Pelican Lake

It's not entirely clear if "Pelican Lake" is just the name of the lake

buildings in the area also goes by the name "Pelican Lake".
