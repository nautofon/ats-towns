## Indirectly deduced names for Utah

### Flaming Gorge

The visitor center bears the name "Flaming Gorge", which also appears
on distance signs. The position used is that of the center of the dam.

### Fort Duchesne

A small sign marking the Ute tribal justice center in "Ft. Duchesne",
plus a single distance sign in Duchesne.

### Herriman

A prominent building bears the text "Herriman City Hall".

### Hole N' The Rock

A group of buildings prominently bears the text `HOLE N"THE ROCK`,
which is transcribed as "Hole N' The Rock" for technical reasons.
(The `"` is used here by the script transforming the bugs.txt format
to GeoJSON as a string delimiter.)
This site is [apparently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_N%22_The_Rock)
a commercial tourist attraction now, but was formerly a place of residence.

### Pelican Lake

It's not entirely clear if "Pelican Lake" is just the name of the lake
itself and the recreation area surrounding it, or if the assembly of
buildings in the area also goes by the name "Pelican Lake".
