## ATS scenery towns in Utah

ATS 1.47

For inclusion criteria etc., see the [repository root](../../../)'s readme.

**These files are incomplete.**

They are simply copies of those mileage targets for Utah that look like they
might represent scenery towns. None of them have actually been verified in
the game yet. A search for additional towns that have no mileage targets
hasn't been undertaken, either, even though such places are known to exist
in Utah.

This is meant as a test of the suitability of the *positions* contained
in the mileage targets dataset for representing scenery towns on a map.
