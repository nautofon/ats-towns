## ATS scenery towns

This repository offers the coordinates of scenery towns in ATS.
It was created in order to allow the
[ATS Slippy Map](https://forum.scssoft.com/viewtopic.php?t=318267)
by [**@truckermudgeon**](https://github.com/truckermudgeon)
to add an extra layer showing scenery towns.

### Criteria for scenery towns

A "scenery town" in ATS is defined here as any settlement not marked by name
on the in-game world map. In this repository, settlements are generally only
included if they meet all of the following criteria:

- Buildings exist in the game world.
- The place name exists in the game world. This usually means the exact name
  must appear on a road sign.
- Buildings and the place name should be independent of each other. In other
  words, if an individual building has a specific name, that particular name
  is not considered to be that of a scenery town.

Since improved navigation is a primary goal here, place names of high
importance might be included here even when not all criteria are met.
In particular, named junctions are currently included even where there is
no real settlement.

A corner case that I don't believe is adequately covered by these criteria
yet are purely touristic features, e.g. in Wyoming "Devils Tower" (currently
included) vs. "South Pass" (on WYO 28 south of Lander; _not_ currently
included). Need to think about this one.

I'm absolutely open to discussing changes to these criteria. The
[ATS Slippy Map thread](https://forum.scssoft.com/viewtopic.php?t=318267)
might be the best place to have such a discussion. Feel free to tag me there
(`@nautofon`).

### Future work

If this collection turns out to be useful, I intend to complete it for most
of ATS eventually.

Beyond that, it might be interesting to expand this idea to other POIs,
such as mountain passes or viewpoints.
