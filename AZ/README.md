## ATS scenery towns in Arizona

ATS 1.47

For inclusion criteria etc., see the [repository root](../../../)'s readme.

The files for Arizona may be considered complete.

However, the towns of **Lupton** and **Sanders** (both east of Holbrook) are
deliberately not included. Neither of them has well-defined limits and their
names only appear on a few destination signs in a way that does not make the
actual location of the towns clear. Here is my best guess of their coordinates,
for future reference:

```
Lupton ;[09/04/2023 14:14:48] (sec-0016+0004);-60375.8;134.411;16180.9;0.0926783;-1.55345
Sanders ;[09/04/2023 14:12:22] (sec-0016+0004);-61637.3;125.008;17237.1;0.730628;-0.316243
```
