## ATS scenery towns

This repository offers the coordinates of scenery towns in ATS.
It was created in order to allow the
[ATS Slippy Map](https://forum.scssoft.com/viewtopic.php?t=318267)
by [**@truckermudgeon**](https://github.com/truckermudgeon)
to add an extra layer showing scenery towns.

### Criteria for scenery towns

A "scenery town" in ATS is defined here as any settlement not marked by name
on the in-game world map. For this repository, such settlements are defined
as locations which meet both of the following criteria:

- Buildings exist in the game world.  
  *Any kind of buildings will do, even commercial or abandoned ones.*

- The place name exists in the game world.  
  *This usually means the exact name must appear on a green road sign.
  Any deduction of place names from e.g. building names or other indirect
  sources should be avoided, except where the situation is super obvious.*

Additionally, the following locations are included if named because of their
navigational value, even where no buildings exist:

- Highway junctions
- Mountain passes

I'm absolutely open to discussing changes to these criteria. The
[ATS Slippy Map thread](https://forum.scssoft.com/viewtopic.php?t=318267)
might be the best place to have such a discussion. Feel free to tag me there
(`@nautofon`).

### Future work

If this collection turns out to be useful, I intend to complete it for most
of ATS eventually.

At least mountain passes should probably be in another dataset instead of
this one. They might be removed here if such a dataset become available
separately in future.

Beyond that, it might be interesting to expand this idea to other POIs,
such as historical markers, rest areas, or viewpoints.
